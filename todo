% try to publish to npm via omtv-react-input and test if it works fine
  with webpack config of the destination project (project that will use
  component generated by this template)
  in case it requires some changes in webpack configuration of the
  destination project document them in README-COMPONENt.md
  (don't forget to sync with omtv-react-input)
- add flow with Comment Types - (add it to the demo webpack bundle)
- use jest + snapshot tests
- use node to generate html demo page for the component and create a separate
  npm script to generate that html page and publish it
- test how this component would work with commonjs require in nodejs
- test how this component would work with node modules (experimental) in nodejs
------------------------------------done----------------------------------------
