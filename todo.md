- scp2 lodash vulnerability (not critical because scp2 is only used for
  deploy script)
  https://github.com/spmjs/node-scp2/issues/116
  https://github.com/spmjs/node-scp2/pull/123

# Done
+ webpack to show only warnings and erros
+ configure jest to support including some unbundled packages
+ style default demo with omtv-theme
+ describe scp2 vulnerability
+ add viewport meta to index.html
+ modify clone.sh so that it copies all required files
+ test default theme
+ test watch npm script
  + document it in README-COMPONENT and maybe README
+ theming
  + add theming approach description or link to it
+ publish component script on vps
+ publish demo `npm run publish-demo` npm script
  use what is built by webpack in demo/dist as a demo page
  matviiv.com/my-component <- demo page for my-component
  demo publish address part should be added to .gitignore for security
  + document publish demo in README-COMPONENT
+ npmignore todo, jestsetup.js, jest.config.js, .test.js files, snspshots
  + sync into omtv-react-input
+ jest with snapshot tests
  we need .babelrc for babel-jest to work properly
  renamed `component` mapping to `componnt` to avoid `component-emmiter` conflict
  + move all jest config to jest.config.js
    avoid having something in package.json that may not be used by user
+ add styled-components
+ remove RELEASES.md and rename todo > todo.md and simply use it as single
  source of truth making done section a releases section, so that it is
  always clear what is included in which release
  + do it both for todo and todo-component
  + update clone.sh to copy todo-component.md > todo.md
  + update omtv-react-input accordingly
+ add note about flow to README-COMPONENT.md
+ add flow with Comment Types - (add it to the demo webpack bundle)
+ try to publish to npm via omtv-react-input and test if it works fine
  with webpack config of the destination project (project that will use
  component generated by this template)
  in case it requires some changes in webpack configuration of the
  destination project document them in README-COMPONENt.md
  (don't forget to sync with omtv-react-input)
  + successfully managed to configure webpack to build specific package from
    node_modules in ~/todo test project
  + update omtv-template-react project with new compatible config
    + update packages to latest versions
    + remove .baberc and only use babel-loader config
    + remove exclude and use include same way as in todo config
  + update omtv-template-react-component and omtv-react-input docs to instruct
    user to either use omtv-template-react configurations to be able to use
    the raw form of the component and provide some dtails about adding specific
    packages to babel-loader...
+ add clone.sh script
+ use clean-webpack-plugin and devserver
+ for html-webpack-plugin title use this
